NDecision
=============

NDecision is a simple engine with a Fluent interface that borrows very much from Behavior Driven Development language. 

Background
-------

NDecision is a Fluent decisioning engine written with Behavior Driven Development principles in mind. It makes business logic easy, allows the encapsulation of logic flow into chainable statements that can be set up and executed on object instances using Lambda syntax. If you're a BDD practitioner, NDecision will allow you to write your BDD rules using easy-to-follow conventions and familiar Gherkin nomenclature. Likewise, if you're a TDD practitioner, your NDecision specifications (the actual rules you write using Lambda expressions) can be used simultaneously in your unit tests. Rather than separate the unit testing code from the true application code, NDecision allows you to write the rules once, test them, and then use them in your real production code.
